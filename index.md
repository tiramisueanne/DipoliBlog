You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/tiramisueanne/DipoliBlog/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

The name Dipoli is a pun: it can mean "dipole", or "The second Poli", ("Dipoli") which would refer to the second building for the polytechnic students at Helsinki University of Technology (Rojas). It was built in 1966 and designed by architects Reima and Raili Pietila.
